        <p>Hi! I'm Luke. Nice to meet you! 👋</p>

        <p>
          I'm a frontend developer based in Bratislava, Slovakia. I'm 23 years
          old. I've always loved new technologies and discovering new ways to
          create things! Hope you enjoy my portfolio! 😊

        <h3 class="font-display text-4xl font-bold">What do I do?</h3>
        <p>
          I've been learing web development since I was 10 years old and I've
          been working as a professional developer since 2019. I've worked in
          multiple companies in both startup and corporate environments. I've
          always been passionate about web development and I always wanted to
          learn as much as I can to keep up with the latest trends. 😊
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working as a frontend developer at a startup called
          Akular as a frontend developer. And I use Vim, btw (had to mention)
