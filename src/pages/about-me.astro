        In my next position, while continuing my studies, I took on the role of
        instructing JavaScript to fellow university students at my alma mater.
        This opportunity allowed me to share my expertise and enthusiasm for
        programming, enhancing my pedagogical skills and reinforcing my
        understanding of JavaScript fundamentals within an academic setting.

        During my university studies, I started a position where I continued to
        harness Angular for development purposes. Additionally, I expanded my
        technical repertoire by writing automated tests using Robot Framework.
        This role was instrumental in the development of a project for a power
        plant, allowing me to contribute significantly while enhancing my skills
        in both front-end development and quality assurance.
