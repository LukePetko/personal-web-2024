    Hi! I'm Luke. Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm a frontend developer based in Bratislava, Slovakia. I'm 23 years old. I've
    always loved new technologies and discovering new ways to create things! Hope
    you enjoy my portfolio! ðŸ˜Š

    I've been learing web development since I was 10 years old and I've been
    working as a professional developer since 20.6. I've worked in multiple
    companies in both startup and corporate environments. I've always been
    passionate about web development and I always wanted to learn as much as I
    can to keep up with the latest trends. ðŸ˜Š

    I'm currently working as a frontend developer at a startup called Akular as a
    frontend developer. And I use Vim, btw (had to mention)
